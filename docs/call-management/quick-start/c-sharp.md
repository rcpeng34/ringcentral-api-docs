# Call Answering Rules C# Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to read preset call answering rules of a user, so that you can see the rule's details and update the rule with new values if you want to. Let's get started.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Call Management App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Give your app a name and description, then click Next.</li>
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard enter the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Select 'Private' for Application Type.</li>
  <li>Select 'Server-only (No UI)' for Platform Type.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>On the third page of the create app wizard, select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>ReadAccounts</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Read User Call Answering Rules

### Create a Visual Studio project

* Choose Console Application .Net Core -> App
* Select Target Framework .NET Core 2.1
* Enter project name "Get_User_Call_Answering_Rules"
* Add NuGet package RingCentral.Net (1.2.1) SDK

### Edit the file Program.cs

Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials.

``` c#
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using RingCentral;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Get_User_Call_Answering_Rules
{
    class Program
    {
        const string RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID = "<ENTER CLIENT ID>";
        const string RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET = "<ENTER CLIENT SECRET>";
        const string RINGCENTRAL_PRODUCTION = false;
        
        const string RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME = "<YOUR ACCOUNT PHONE NUMBER>";
        const string RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD = "<YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD>";
        const string RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION = "<YOUR EXTENSION, PROBABLY '101'>";

        static RestClient restClient;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            restClient = new RestClient(RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID, RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET, RINGCENTRAL_PRODUCTION);
            restClient.Authorize(RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME, RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION, RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD).Wait();
            get_user_call_answering_rules().Wait();
        }
        static private async Task get_user_call_answering_rules()
        {
            var parameters = new ListAnsweringRulesParameters();
            parameters.view = "Detailed";
            parameters.enabledOnly = "false";

            var resp = await restClient.Restapi().Account().Extension().AnsweringRule().List(parameters);
            foreach (var record in resp.records)
            {
                var rule = await restClient.Restapi().Account().Extension().AnsweringRule(record.id).Get();
                Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(rule));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Run Your App

You are almost done. Now run your app from Visual Studio.
